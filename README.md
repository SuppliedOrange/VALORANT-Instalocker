## ‚ùî How to use

- Start VALORANT
- Select any agent from the left-hand-side list
- Instalocking should begin automatically

- If an error occurs try:
    1) Selecting another agent and selecting the previous one again
    2) Stopping and starting the instalock
    3) Reopening the application
    4) Logging into VALORANT again

## ‚ùì Can I get banned?

Not likely. Unless you go around telling everyone you have an instalocker. Don't boast it or flaunt it and use it reasonably.
<br>
> [@deadly](https://github.com/deadly): With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, the anticheat shouldn't be triggered. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this method. All things considered, I would use this only on an alt account if you don't want to risk the 7 day API abuse account suspension on your main, albeit unlikely.

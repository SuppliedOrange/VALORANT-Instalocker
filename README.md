- Allows you to switch between characters while instalocking
- Stops instalocking and sending API requests as soon as an error is found

## ‚ùî How to use

- Start VALORANT
- Select any agent from the left-hand-side list
- Instalocking should begin automatically

- If an error occurs try:
    1) Selecting another agent and selecting the previous one again
    2) Stopping and starting the instalock
    3) Reopening the application
    4) Logging into VALORANT again

## ‚ùå Windows protected your PC
THe application might refuse to run because Windows will assume this is malicious.
<br>
The fix is pretty simple, click on `More Info` and click on `Run Anyway`
<br>
Is that safe? Yes, it is. Windows protects your PC because this is an unsigned executable from an external source. If you're feeling a little paranoid, you can build it yourself with the instructions below!

<br>

## ‚ùì Can I get banned?

Not likely. Unless you go around telling everyone you have an instalocker. Don't boast it or flaunt it and use it reasonably.
<br>
> [@deadly](https://github.com/deadly): With all programs like this, there is no guarantee that it's safe because using the VALORANT API in this manner is against Riot's Terms of Service. However, this program does not use an autoclicker to select the agent, read the game's memory, or change the game's files; therefore, the anticheat shouldn't be triggered. No suspensions have been reported so far from using this method of exploit. All things considered, I would use this only on an alt account if you don't want to risk the 7 day API abuse account suspension on your main, albeit unlikely.

## üõ† Building 

- I have used Python 3.10.10, I am not sure what other versions are compatible.

- Download and open the repository

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Building a distributable:
    <br>
    - Run `python -m eel main.py web --onefile --noconsole --icon=./web/favicon.ico --name="VALORANT Instalocker" --paths ./venv/Lib/site-packages`
    - A distributable should appear in ./dist

- Running with python: 
    <br>
    - Run `python main.py`

- Most Agent previews (sprays and official stickers) are from the official [VALORANT giphy page](https://giphy.com/playvalorant)
- Some of the agent previews come from unknown sources, let me know if you find their sources!
